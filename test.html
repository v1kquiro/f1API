        Formula One is a high-level international auto racing competition 
        that takes place over multiple races, or Grand Prix, across the world.
        As some may call it, the pinnacle of motorsport</p></div><br>

        <div class="containertxt3"><p>
        Formula 1 is enjoyed by more than half a billion people, and more than 400 000 people attend Grand Prix's 
        every year.

        Did you know there is also a Formula 1 netflix documentary, and this year, 2024, is going to have some epic moments in there,
        some very good, like Lando NoWins (Norris) getting his very first victory, and Charles Leclerc breaking his home race curse, and winning
        the Monaco Grand Prix, and sadly our favorite Daniel Ricciardo's final race in Singapore. This year's Drive to Survive season is going to insane.
